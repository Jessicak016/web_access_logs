This project shows my application of Python regular expressions to an important real-world problem: filtering Web access logs.  

A Web access log records every HTTP request made to a Web server, along with features such as the date, time, 
IP address of the computer making the HTTP request, and the requestâ€™s resulting status code (e.g. 200 == success).  
Log analysis and filtering is an important method for identifying valid vs. suspicious requests, as you will see from this project.
